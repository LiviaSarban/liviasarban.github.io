# Lessons Learned:

## January 1st, 2016 Session:

1. Create your own workflow. Workflow suggestion:
* start with a wireframe;
* create the HTML code;
* add stylesheets and other attachments;
* write CSS;
* test in browser.
2. For responsive design, use min-width rather than max-width.
3. Don't forget to add <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> in the HTML head: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/responsive-meta-tag/
4. Make sure the line-height is at least the same size like the font size.

*Still wondering how to:*
1. Set the zoom level on a map. The most popular idea seems to be to use the API because it gives a lot more flexibility: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide
2. Make the second paragraph of text from the "Hi there!" section wrap around the image at smaller screen sizes.

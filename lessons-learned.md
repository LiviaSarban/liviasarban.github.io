# What I learned/ Random thoughts

1. To set the zoom level on a Google Maps, it would be best to use the API since it gives you a lot more flexibility in terms of options: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide
2. When making an image responsive make sure the the size of the image doesn't go up and down between queries (for now my best idea is max-width and min-width).
3. There is something really funky about the display on my Samsung Galaxy S6 and I suppose it's related to the fact that I didn't set the device type on the media queries just the width breakpoints.
4. Below 920px I should probably wrap the text around the image/ make the second paragraph take up 100% of the space available.
5. I want "Hi there!" to be aligned with the top of the image, but I have no idea what I did to make it be a bit lower :scream:
6. I feel my headings are a bit too big, but don't know which would be the correct ratio between them.
7. :omg: Github recognizes emojis, I forgot about that - best thing today :grin:
